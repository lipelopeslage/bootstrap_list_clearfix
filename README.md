# bootstrap_list_clearfix
A very simple, small solution for cleaning the float of a &lt;ul> or &lt;ol> using bootstrap column classes.
Why we need to do that?!?! Well, sometimes we want to list more items inside a list than we're suposed according to grid limits. With this solution you will still enjoy the benefits from responsive adaptable states using the same list.<br>
*Obs: This code uses jQuery to select and iterate elements lists.
